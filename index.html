	<p>Did you know, The United States has the highest number of guns per capita in the world, with 89 firearms per 100 people?</p>
	<p>Would banning guns lead to reduced crime rate? Although it’s a question to one’s freedom and security, after a mass shooting leaving 14 people dead at San Bernardino, the question of imposing stricter laws on gun acquisition has been reignited. As humans, we all have strong urge to preserve ourselves, to survive and defend ourselves from any threat and to deny one of defending him/herself would be equal to enslaving them. But, people needed a gun for that back in the 1900s, now with advanced technological advancements in the sector of security, one might hardly find a need for a gun, unless for social status or to kill others. </p>
